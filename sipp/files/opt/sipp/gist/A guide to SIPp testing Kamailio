SIPp Box 
1. Download and Modify SIPp to auto respond always and include OPTIONS packet as well (-aa broken?), edit src/call.cpp:

call::T_AutoMode call::checkAutomaticResponseMode(char * P_recv)
{
    if (strcmp(P_recv, "BYE")==0) {
        return E_AM_UNEXP_BYE;
    } else if (strcmp(P_recv, "CANCEL") == 0) {
        return E_AM_UNEXP_CANCEL;
    } else if (strcmp(P_recv, "PING") == 0) {
        return E_AM_PING;
    } else if ((strcmp(P_recv, "INFO") == 0) || (strcmp(P_recv, "NOTIFY") == 0) || (strcmp(P_recv, "UPDATE") == 0) || (strcmp(P_recv, "OPTIONS") == 0)
               ) {
        return E_AM_AA;
    } else {
        return E_AM_DEFAULT;
    }
}

!!! TODO !!!

* Clean this code later and submit a patch to SIPp's developers


2. Compile sipp-3.3.990 with RTP Support: http://sipp.sourceforge.net/doc/reference.html#Installing+SIPp

3. To run the test, from SIPp Box: 
# sipp 10.254.1.30 -i 10.254.1.40 -sf uac.xml -aa -inf accounts.csv -l 10000 -r 1 -rp 1000 -trace_msg -trace_err -trace_stat

!!! NOTES !!!

* Parameter explanation:
10.254.1.30 = target Kamailio's IP on the LAN A side (see network diagram)
-i 10.254.1.40 = make sure to bind SIPp on this IP especially if we are using IP Authentication on Kamailio
-sf uac.xml = use this scenario file that generates calls.
-inf accounts.csv = use this input CSV file, this is where the [field0],[field1],[field2] and [field3] values are derived in uac.xml. Edit this file accordingly in format: CallID;Kamailio LAN A IP;[authentication];Extension on Asterisk 2 (If running SIPp server mode, this wont matter);Asterisk 2 LAN B IP;
-l 10000 = run 1000 times
-r 1 -rp 1000 = one call per 1000ms (1 secs) 
-trace_msg = log all messages to a file (filename auto generated)
-trace_err = log all errors to a separate file (filename auto generated)
-trace_stat = generate a CSV file with statistics which is good for making graphs (default 1 minute interval) 


* make sure to edit the accounts.csv, change 10.254.1.30 and 10.254.7.31 accordingly.

* make sure to edit the uac.xml, change Route: <sip:10.254.1.30;r2=on;lr=on;nat=yes>,<sip:10.254.3.30;r2=on;lr=on;nat=yes> accordingly since sipp-3.3.990 can't reliably generate this header so we had to hard code this for now. (Many thanks to Gohar Ahmed for helping me figure this out, check out his blog http://saevolgo.blogspot.com/)


4. You may run a SIPp on Asterisk 2 box to test higher concurrent calls (eg: testing more than 200 concurrent calls).

5. Lets shutdown Asterisk 2
# asterisk -rx "core stop now"

6. To run a server listening to incoming calls (server mode), run:
# sipp 10.254.7.30 -i 10.254.7.31 -sf uas.xml -aa -trace_msg -trace_err -trace_stat

!!! NOTES !!!

* Parameter explanation:
10.254.7.30 = target Kamailio's IP on the LAN B side (see network diagram)
-i 10.254.7.31 = make sure to bind SIPp on this IP especially if we are using IP Authentication on Kamailio
-sf uas.xml = use this scenario file that responds to calls.
-aa = enable auto responds so our uas.xml is shorter.
-trace_msg -trace_err -trace_stat = generate logs, maybe not needed since we have them on SIPp box already.

* don't use -l -m -r -rp on SIPp running server mode or else your affecting the call rates set on SIPp box and ends up failing the test (learned this the hard way)

*  make sure to edit the uas.xml, change the Routes header accordingly. Eg:
      Record-Route: <sip:10.254.7.30;r2=on;lr=on;nat=yes>
      Record-Route: <sip:10.254.3.30;r2=on;lr=on;nat=yes>

!!! TIPS !!!

* Run this on Asterisk X and Y during test to see the calls being load balanced:
# watch -n 10 'asterisk -rx "sip show channels" | tail -n 1'

* If you abort a test prematurely using force quit (double tap q on SIPp or CTRL+C), you will end up with lots of SIP channels still open on Asterisk X & Y and Asterisk 2. Run this command if you don't want to wait it to timeout and clear out before re-running the test (or else your test will receive lots of Dead call errors). Run this over and over until theres 2 or less SIP channels open:
# asterisk -rx "channel request hangup all"

* Asterisk X & Y opens may open twice as many SIP channels as there is calls received, don't be alarmed -- it's normal.

* You may need to fine tune your SIPp box to allow more ports: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/410616/increasing-the-maximum-number-of-tcp-ip-connections-in-linux

* You can define an echo test extension on Asterisk 2, call this extension using your softphone (recommended: http://phonerlite.de/download_en.htm) while testing to get immediate feed back on voice quality. An example echo test service on 4001, add to /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf:
[sipp]
exten=4001,1,Answer
exten=4001,n,Echo
